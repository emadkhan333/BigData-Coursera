# Data Stream #
Streaming Data Processing Applications is the need to process data as it is generated. An example application would be making data-driven marketing decisions in real time. Through the use of data from real-time sales trends, social media analysis, and sales distributions. Another example for streaming data processing is monitoring of industrial or farming machinery in real time.

## What is a Data Stream ##
A stream is defined as a possibly unbounded sequence of data items or records. That may or may not be related to, or correlated with each other. Each data is generally timestamped and in some cases geo-tagged. As you have seen in our examples, the data can stream from many sources. Including instruments, and many internet of things application areas, computer programs, websites, or social media posts. 
Streaming data sometimes get referred to as event data as each data item is treated as an individual event in a synchronized sequence. 

**Difficulties in Streaming Data**
Streams pose very difficult challenges for conventional data management architectures. Which are built primarily on the concept of persistence, static data collections. Due to the fact that most often we have only one chance to look at and process streaming data before more gets piled on. Streaming data management systems cannot be separated from real-time processing of data. Managing and processing data in motion is a typical capability of streaming data systems. 

**Dynamic Streaming**
Dynamic steering is often a part of streaming data management and processing. A self-driving car is a perfect example of a dynamic steering application. But all streaming data applications fall into this category. Amazon Kinesis an other open-source Apache projects like Storm, Flink, Spark Streaming, and Samza are examples of big data streaming systems. Many other companies also provide streaming systems for big data that are frequently updated in response to the rapidly changing nature of these technologies.
